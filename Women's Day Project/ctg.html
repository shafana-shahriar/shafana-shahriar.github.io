            Catherine was born in Stettin,Holy Roman Empire as Princess Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg.Sophie(Catherine's real name) had a very uneventful childhood and although she was a princess and her family was royalty they had very little money.Her rise to power was supported by mother's wealthy relatives.Young Sophie had been groomed to be the wife of some powerful ruler in order to improve the position of the reigning house of Anhalt.Catherine was tutored in religious studies by a military chaplain but questioned much of what he taught her. She also learned three languages: German, French and Russian, the last of which came in handy when Catherine's mother wrangled an invitation to St. Petersburg from Elizabeth of Russia.
