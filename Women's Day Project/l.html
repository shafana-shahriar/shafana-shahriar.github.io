        Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi, was an Indian queen, the Maharani consort of the Maratha princely state of Jhansi from 1843 to 1853 as the wife of Maharaja Gangadhar Rao. She was one of the leading figures of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and became a symbol of resistance to the British Raj for Indian nationalists. Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November 1828 in the town of Varanasi into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family. She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu. Her father was Moropant Tambe and her mother Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came from Maharashtra.

        She got married at the age of 7 and became Rani. The marriage was not consummated until Lakshmi was 14, in 1849. After her marriage, she was given the name of Laxmi after the Indian goddess. Lakshmi Bai is remembered for her valour during the Indian Mutiny of 1857-58. During a siege of the fort of Jhansi, Bai offered stiff resistance to the invading forces and did not surrender even after her troops were overwhelmed. She was later killed in combat after having successfully assaulted Gwalior.
