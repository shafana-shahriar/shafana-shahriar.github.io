                <h1>The Crust</h1>
                <p>The Earth's Crust describes the outermost shell of a terrestrial planet. The crust is made up of several different rocks, which are lighter than the rocks that make up the mantle. The crust is deepest in the mountainous area where i can be up to 70km thick.</p>

                <p>The crust is a thin but important zone where dry, hot rock from the deep Earth reacts with the water and oxygen of the surface, making new kinds of minerals and rocks. It's also where plate-tectonic activity mixes and scrambles these new rocks and injects them with chemically active fluids.</p>

                <p> The crust is generally divided into older, thicker continental crust and younger, denser oceanic crust. The continental crust makes up the land on Earth while the oceanic crust forms the Earth's oceans. The continental and oceanic crusts are bonded to the mantle where it forms a layer called the litosphere.</p>

                <h1>The Mantle</h1>
                <p>A mantle is a layer inside a planetary body bounded below by a core and above by a crust. Mantles are made of rock or ices, and are generally the largest and most massive layer of the planetary body. Mantles are characteristic of planetary bodies that have undergone differentiation by density</p>

                <p>The mantle makes up 84% of the earths volume and extends 35 to 2980 kiliometers below Earth's surface. It is mostly solid rock but ranges in tempertures from 200 to 4000 degrees Celsius.In terms of its constituent elements, the mantle is made up of 44.8% oxygen, 21.5% silicon, and 22.8% magnesium. There's also iron, aluminum, calcium, sodium, and potassium. These elements are all bound together in the form of silicate rocks, all of which take the form of oxides. The mantle is semi-liquid, sort of like a malleable plastic and is 2,900 km thick and is broken down into 3 main zones, the lithosphere and the asthenosphere

                <h1>The Core</h1>
                <p>Earth's core is the very hot, very dense center of our planet. The ball-shaped core lies beneath the cool, brittle crust and the mostly-solid mantle. The core is found about 2,900 kilometers (1,802 miles) below Earth's surface, and has a radius of about 3,485 kilometers (2,165 miles).</p>

                <p>The core in the Earth consists of two layers: the outer core and inner core. Both the inner and outer cores consist primarily of iron and nickel. They're extremely hot, with temperatures ranging from 7200–9000℉ (4000–5000℃). The inner core is under intense pressure, which keeps it solid despite high temperatures. Outer Core: The outer core, which is liquid, is about 1300 miles (2092 km) thick.</p>

                <p> There are three main sources of heat in the deep earth: (1) heat from when the planet formed and accreted, which has not yet been lost; (2) frictional heating, caused by denser core material sinking to the center of the planet; and (3) heat from the decay of radioactive elements.</p>

                <h1>The Lithosphere</h1>
                <p>The lithosphere is the solid, outer part of the Earth. The lithosphere includes the brittle upper portion of the mantle and the crust, the outermost layers of Earth's structure. It is bounded by the atmosphere above and the asthenosphere (another part of the upper mantle) below.Lithosphere provide us forests, grasslands for grazing land for agriculture and human settlements and also rich source of minerals. The lithosphere contains different types of rocks such as the igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, it helps to provide the necessary nutrients required to plants.</p>

                <p>The lithosphere is made up of rocks and minerals that form the crust and the upper mantle. The crust is the upper part of the lithosphere that humans interact with on a daily basis. It is made of the rocks and soil that make up the ground. The lithosphere is about 100 km thick, although the older the older lithosphere is thicker. The oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 170 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old .Convection currents in the mantle cause the heating of Earth's plates and therefore, cause them to move. When warm material rises up, the cold material sinks down and this pattern repeats over and over. This causes the plates to rise and move.</p>

                <h1>The Asthenosphere</h1>
                <p>The asthenosphere is the denser, weaker layer beneath the lithospheric mantle. It lies between about 100 kilometers (62 miles) and 410 kilometers (255 miles) beneath Earth's surface. The temperature and pressure of the asthenosphere are so high that rocks soften and partly melt, becoming semi-molten. Seismic waves pass relatively slowly through the asthenosphere compared to the overlying lithospheric mantle.
                </p>

                <p>The Asthenosphere is made up of semi-plastic rock. Since the Lithosphere has a lower density, it floats on top of the Asthenosphere similar to the way in which an iceberg or a block of wood floats on water. The lower mantle below the Asthenosphere is more rigid and less plastic. The asthenosphere is made of very viscous, ductile, semi-solid material on which the lithosphere moves. It is a solid that can behave like a liquid, and it is about 440km thick.The asthenosphere includes the portion of the mantle with temperatures above 2,372°F.</p>
