                <h1>Oceans</h1>
                <p>The ocean (the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the Earth surface and contains 97% of Earth's water. An ocean refers to any of the large bodies of water into which the world is conventionally divided.The Oceans are divided into 5 different regions: <a href="#thepaci">the Pacific</a>; <a href="#thearct">the Arctic</a>; <a href="#theatla">the Atlantic</a>; <a href="#theindi">the Indian</a>; <a href="#thesou">the Southern</a>. The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean while the Arctic Ocean is the smallest. The Indian Ocean is located right below India and the Southern Ocean is right near Antartica. </p>
                <p>The ocean is the principle component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore essential for life on Earth.Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle.</p>
                <p>Ocean water contains large quantities of dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This gas exchange takes place at the ocean surface and solubility depends on the temperature and salinity of the water.[8] The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel combustion leads to higher concentrations in ocean water, resulting in ocean acidification.[9] The ocean provides society with important environmental services, including climate regulation. It also offers a means of trade and transport and access to food and other resources. Known to be the habitat of over 230,000 species, it may contain far more – perhaps over two million species.[10] However, the ocean is subject to numerous environmental threats, including marine pollution, overfishing, ocean acidification and other effects of climate change. The continental shelf and coastal waters that are most influenced by human activity are especially vulnerable.</p>

                <p>The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions. It spans 60 million square miles from California to China, and in certain regions extends tens of thousands of feet below the surface of the water. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south, and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. The Pacific Ocean has an area of 165.2 million km2, a mean depth of 4280 m, and a water volume of 710,000,000 km3. The Pacific Ocean stretches from the Bering Strait near the Arctic Circle to the shores of Antarctica through 135° of latitude, some 9,600 miles((15,500 km).</p>

                <p>Important human migrations occured in the Pacific in prehistoric times. Modern humans first reached the western Pacific in the Paleolithic(around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago). Originating from a southern coastal human migration out of Africa, they reached East Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, the Philippines, New Guinea, and Australia via the now sunken land bridges of Sundaland and Sahul. The descendants of these migrations today are the East Asian peoples, the Negritos, Melanesians, and Indigenous Australians. These groups did not have boat or sailing technology at the beginning, and thus could only cross short distances of water. Their populations in maritime Southeast Asia, coastal New Guinea, and Island Melanesia later intermarried with the incoming Austronesian settlers from Taiwan and the northern Philippines, but also earlier groups associated with Austroasiatic-speakers, resulting in the modern peoples of Island Southeast Asia and Oceania.</p>
                <p>The Pacific Ocean contains some of the deepest points in the world such as the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, which is located in the western north Pacific, which is the deepest point in the world, which reaches a depth of 10,928 meters. The second deepest point is alsi in the Pacific which is located in the Southern Hemisphere, the Horizon Deep in the Tonga Trench, at 10823 meters. The third deepest point on Earth, the Sirena Deep, is also located in the Mariana Trench.</p>

                <h1>The Indian Ocean</h1>
                <p>The Indian Ocean is the third-largest of the world's five oceanic divisions, covering 70,560,000 km2 or ~19.8% of the water on Earth's surface. It is bounded by Asia to the north, Africa to the west and Australia to the east. The Indian Ocean has an area 70.56 million km 2, a mean depth of 3,890 m and water volume of . Its deepest point is in the Java Trench at 7,258 m. The Indian Ocean has a max length of 9,600 km (from Antartica to the Bay of Bengal) and a max width of 7,600 km (from Africa to Australia). The ocean was explored by British navigator and explorer James Cook in 1772.</p>
                <p>Indian Ocean hosts one of the most important global maritime routes connecting Far East with Europe. It passes though the South China Sea, Strait of Malacca, Indian Ocean, Red Sea, Suez Canal and Mediterranean until Atlantic, and carries majority of the ultra-large containerships. Another major export item along the classical Indian Ocean trade routes was religious thought. Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism spread from India to Southeast Asia, brought by merchants rather than by missionaries. Islam would later spread the same way from the 700s CE on. The Indian Ocean's key subregions are South Asia, the Middle East, the eastern coast of Africa, and the islands dotting the ocean from Sri Lanka in the East to the Comoros Archipelago in the West. The region's size and diversity explains its geoeconomic importance.</p>
                <p>Several features make the Indian Ocean unique. It constitutes the core of the large-scale Tropical Warm Pool which, when interacting with the atmosphere,</p>

            <div class="col text-center py-2">
                <p>affects the climate both regionally and globally. Asia blocks heat export and prevents the ventilation of the Indian Ocean thermocline. That continent also drives the Indian Ocean monsoon, the strongest on Earth, which causes large-scale seasonal variations in ocean currents, including the reversal of the Somali Current and Indian Monsoon Current. The climate north of the equator is affected by a monsoon climate. Strong north-east winds blow from October until April; from May until October south and west winds prevail. In the Arabian Sea, the violent Monsoon brings rain to the Indian subcontinent. In the southern hemisphere, the winds are generally milder, but summer storms near Mauritius can be severe. When the monsoon winds change, cyclones sometimes strike the shores of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The Indian Ocean is the warmest ocean in the world.</p>

                <p>The Indian Ocean has been known by its present name since at least 1515 when the Latin form Oceanus Orientalis Indicus ("Indian Eastern Ocean") is attested, named for India, which projects into it. It was earlier known as the Eastern Ocean, a term that was still in use during the mid-18th century (see map), as opposed to the Western Ocean (Atlantic) before the Pacific was surmised. Conversely, Chinese explorers in the Indian Ocean during the 15th century called it the Western Oceans. In Ancient Greek geography, the Indian Ocean region known to the Greeks was called the Erythraean Sea.</p>

                <h1 >The Atlantic Ocean</h1>
                <p>The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's five oceans, with an area of about 106,460,000 km2. It covers approximately 20% of Earth's surface and about 29% of its water surface area. It has a area of 106.5 milion km 2, an average water temperature between 42°F and 86°F, an average depth of 3646 m and water volume of 310,410,900 km 3. The Atlantic drives our weather patterns, including hurricanes, and is hom to many species from sea turtles to dolphins. For centuries, the ocean has been used as a key avenue for trade and travel.<p>

                <p>The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Europe and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west. As one component of the interconnected World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south. The Atlantic Ocean is divided in two parts, by the Equatorial Counter Current, with the North(ern) Atlantic Ocean and the South(ern) Atlantic Ocean.</p>

                <p>The oldest known mentions of an "Atlantic" sea come from Stesichorus around mid-sixth century BC and in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC where the name refers to "the sea beyond the pillars of Heracles" which is said to be part of the sea that surrounds all land. In both these mentions, the name refers to Atlas, the Titan in Greek mythology, who supported the heavens and who later appeared as a frontispiece in Medieval maps and also lent his name to modern atlases.</p>

                <p>The formation of the Atlantic Ocean occured about 150 million years ago when a rift was opened/created within the supercontinent of Pangaea. A new crust formed along the underwater Mid-Atlantic Ridge which drove the breakup of Pangaea and formed the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

                <p>The Mid-Atlantic Ridge divides the Atlantic longitudinally into 2 halves, in each of which a series of basins are delimited by secondary, transverse ridges. The MAR reaches above 2,000 m (6,600 ft) along most of its length, but is interrupted by larger transform faults at two places: the Romanche Trench near the Equator and the Gibbs Fracture Zone at 53°N. The MAR is a barrier for bottom water, but at these two transform faults deep water currents can pass from one side to the other.</p>

                <p>The largest sea in the Atlantic Ocean is the Sargosso Sea((3.5 million km2). The second largest is the Caribbean Sea (2.754 million km 2) and the third being the Mediterranean sea (2.510 million km 2)</p>

                <h1>The Southern Ocean</h1>
                <p>The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. It has an area of 20.3 million km2, a mean depth of 3,200 m . The Southern Ocean is made up of the portions of the world ocean south of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans and their tributary seas surrounding Antarctica below 60° S. The Southern Ocean is bounded to the south by the Antarctic continent. Its northern “boundary” is not well defined. The Antarctic Treaty Limit at 60°S could be taken as a political northern limit of the Southern Ocean. However, the Southern Ocean oceanographic regime extends well north of 60°S
                </p>
                <p> The Southern Ocean is the world's fourth-largest ocean. Surrounding the South Pole and Antarctica, it is the only ocean that goes all the way around the globe. Parts of the ocean freeze in winter, forming huge sheets of ice. Very high winds mean that the Southern Ocean is choppy, with huge waves. The name for the ocean was approved in 1999 soon after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recognized the body of water as the fifth ocean.</p>
                <p>Borders and names for oceans and seas were internationally agreed when the International Hydrographic Bureau, the precursor to the IHO, convened the First International Conference on 24 July 1919. The IHO then published these in its Limits of Oceans and Seas, the first edition being 1928. Since the first edition, the limits of the Southern Ocean have moved progressively southwards; since 1953, it has been omitted from the official publication and left to local hydrographic offices to determine their own limits. The IHO included the ocean and its definition as the waters south of the 60th parallel south in its 2000 revisions, but this has not been formally adopted, due to continuing impasses about some of the content, such as the naming dispute over the Sea of Japan. The 2000 IHO definition, however, was circulated in a draft edition in 2002, and is used by some within the IHO and by some other organizations such as the CIA World Factbook and Merriam-Webster. The Australian Government regards the Southern Ocean as lying immediately south of Australia</p>
                <p>Southern Ocean" is an obsolete name for the Pacific Ocean or South Pacific, coined by Vasco Núñez de Balboa, the first European to discover it, who approached it from the north. The "South Seas" is a less archaic synonym. A 1745 British Act of Parliament established a prize for discovering a Northwest Passage to "the Western and Southern Ocean of America".</p>
                <p>In Australia, cartographical authorities define the Southern Ocean as including the entire body of water between Antarctica and the south coasts of Australia and New Zealand, and up to 60°S elsewhere. Coastal maps of Tasmania and South Australia label the sea areas as Southern Ocean and Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia is described as the point where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.
                </p>
                <p>Exploration of the Southern Ocean was inspired by a belief in the existence of a Terra Australis – a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of Eurasia and North Africa – which had existed since the times of Ptolemy. The rounding of the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 by Bartolomeu Dias first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold, and proved that there was an ocean separating Africa from any Antarctic land that might exist.</p>

                <h1 >The Arctic Ocean</h1>
                <p>The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. It spans an area of approximately 14,060,000 km² and is known as the coldest of all the oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea.It has an area of 14.06 million km² and a mean depth of 1,038 m.</p>
                <p>The Arctic Ocean is centered approximately on the North Pole. Although the Arctic Ocean is one of the smallest oceans it is still almost two times the size of Australia. The Arctic Ocean is also less than 200 million years old with the oldest parts of its floor dating between 80 million to 67 million years. Its seasonal average water temperature is between 31°F and 59°F.</p>
                <p>The volume of water in the Arctic is 160.7 million mi3 and the total coastline is 28,203 miles.Most of the Arctic Ocean is covered by ice throughout the year—although that is starting to change as temperatures climb. Pale and stark on the surface, the Arctic Ocean is home to a stunning array of life. The Arctic Ocean occupies a roughly circular basin and covers an area of about 14,056,000 km2 (5,427,000 sq mi), almost the size of Antarctica.  It is the only ocean smaller than Russia.It is surrounded by the land masses of Eurasia, North America (including Greenland), and Iceland. It is generally taken to include Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Iceland Sea, Norwegian Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, White Sea and other tributary bodies of water. It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the Bering Strait and to the Atlantic Ocean through the Greenland Sea and Labrador Sea.</p>
                <p>Much of the Arctic Ocean is covered by sea ice that varies in extent and thickness seasonally. The mean extent of the Arctic sea ice has been continuously decreasing in the last decades, declining at a rate of currently 12.85% per decade since 1980 from the average winter value of 15,600,000 km2.</p>
                <p>The Arctic Ocean is contained in a polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges. Winters are characterized by the polar night, extreme cold, frequent low-level temperature inversions, and stable weather conditions</p>
