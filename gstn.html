        Mother Teresa was born in North Macedonia, in 1910, as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. She was a nun and a missionary and founded the organization called Missionaries of Charity.When she was young, she wanted to be a missionary so she joined the Sister of Loreto who were irish nuns who also worked in India. She was trained in Dublin and sent to India.

        Mother Terasa became a teacher in Calcutta and started teaching at St. Mary's High School where she taught history and geography and in 1944 she became the principal of the same school. While in Calcutta, Mother Terasa was saddened to see the poverty in the slums and their living conditions and in 1946 when she fell ill , she was sent to the hills to recover where she felt a divine call from withing herself to help the poor and ill so two years later she left St. Mary's High School and began to work among the sick and poor.

        Mother Terasa learned basic medicine , she nursed sick and dying people and also taught the poor children. In later years she rented a room to look after these people and the following year she named this group the Missonaries of Charities.She had also opened a home for the dying in a temple in Calcutta which was later renamed Nirmal Hriday ( Home of the Pure Heart) where she gave them medicine , took care of them and prayed for them. But that was'nt enough for her because she wanted to help more people so she went to Africa to feed the hungry. She set up 450 help centres around the world and because of her work, she had also won a nobel prize for peace in 1979.
