    <h4>Reducing Disaster Risk</h4>

    <p>Every two years, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) works with thinkers, practitioners, experts and innovators to investigate the state of risk across the globe: highlighting whatâ€™s new, spotting emerging trends, revealing disturbing patterns, examining behaviour, and presenting progress in reducing risk. The findings make up the 2019 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction.</p>

    <p>An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane.</p>


    <!-- Floods -->

    <button class="fdt"><a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood">Floods</a></button>

    <p>A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are an area of study in the discipline of hydrology. They are the most common and widespread natural severe weather event.</p>

    <!-- Wildfires -->

    <button class="wdt"><a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire">Wildfires</a></button>

    <p>A wildfire, bushfire, wildland fire or rural fire is an unplanned, unwanted, uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible vegetation starting in rural areas and urban areas.</p>

    <!-- Tornandoes -->

    <button class="tt"><a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado">Tornadoes</a></button>

    <p>Tornadoes form when warm, humid air collides with cold, dry air. The denser cold air is pushed over the warm air, usually producing thunderstorms. As the rotating updraft, called a mesocycle, draws in more warm air from the moving thunderstorm, its rotation speed increases</p>
