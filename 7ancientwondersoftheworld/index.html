    <p class="MaH"> ⊛ The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus or Tomb of Mausolus was a tomb built between 353 and 350 BC in Halicarnassus for Mausolus, a native Anatolian from Caria and a satrap in the Achaemenid Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria. The structure was designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythias of Priene.
    </p>
    <p class="MaH"> ⊛  This mausoleum was classified as a wonder because it distances itself by its beauty and its great value. Indeed, the ornaments of the sanctuary were realized by the most famous artists of its era: Satyrus and Pythius for the architecture; Scopas, Timotheos, Bryaxis and Leochares for the sculpture.
    </p>
    <p class="MaH"> ⊛  The Mausoleum was probably destroyed by an earthquake between the 11th and the 15th century CE, and the stones were reused in local buildings. Section of the Amazon frieze from the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, attributed to Pytheos, c. 350 BCE; in the British Museum, London.

    <p class="HGoB">  ∾  The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were the fabled gardens which beautified the capital of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, built by its greatest king Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 605-562 BCE). 
    </p>
    <p class="HGoB">  ∾  The true location of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon remains an unsolved mystery, but the latest research suggests looking in a different place.
    </p>
    <p class="HGoB">  ∾  King Nebuchadnezzar II ruled Babylon from 605BC, for a period of 43 years. It was during this time that he is said to have had the Hanging Gardens built. If the gardens actually existed, it would have taken 8,200 gallons of water each day to keep the plants watered. The gardens were thought to be about 75 feet high
    </p>
    <p class="HGoB">  ∾  Some historians and archaeologists believe that the gardens were destroyed by war and erosion, while others believe an earthquake destroyed them. Cuneiform is an ancient language dating back to the Babylonian era, that was also used by the Assyrian empires.

    <p class="LHoA"> ☆ The Lighthouse of Alexandria, sometimes called the Pharos of Alexandria, was a lighthouse built by the Ptolemaic Kingdom, during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, which has been estimated to be at least 100 metres in overall height . The Lighthouse of Alexandria was named the 7th Wonder of the Ancient World due to the high quality of its architectural design, it was one of the longest standing Wonders but after the lighthouse was severely damaged by three earthquakes between 956 AD and 1323 and became an abandoned ruin . The earthquakes had turned the lighthouse into a pile of rubble, much of the stone was used to build a citadel in the same spot. It was a technological triumph and is the archetype of all lighthouses since.
    </p>
    <p class="LHoA"> ☆ Pharos was a small island located on the western edge of the Nile Delta. In 332 BC Alexander the Great founded the city of Alexandria on an isthmus opposite Pharos.
